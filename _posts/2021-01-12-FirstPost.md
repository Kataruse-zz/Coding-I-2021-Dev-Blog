<h3>Introduction</h3>
Hello! My name is Nick Crump and i'am currently taking a Coding 1 class. 
This blog will be somewhat daily updated to reflect my progress that i've been making in this class. 
So far we've made Intro Slide decks for ourselfs and here is mine

<h3>Goals</h3>
Some of the things I hope to learn how to do in this class are building my first real working website and to be able to understand and remember how to code.
<br/>
<h3>Career</h3>
I personally don't really know what I want to do in life as a career yet but I know I want to go into something related 
to technology and computers. My reasoning is because it's something i've always been around and interested in and it seems 
like a job that will always be in demand.

<h3>GitHub</h3>
For the past week or so we've been working with GitHub created a presentation about ourselfs using it. 
From what i've learned GitHub is like an online version of working within a folder with notepad which i've done before. 
The only think that suprised me with GitHub is seeing how much I remembered from my first coding class I took. The only 
things at the moment that I want to learn is how to center images with markdown, i've tried using HTML and CSS but those 
are work together in two different sheets since HTML is a stucture language and is limited in the styling options and CSS is only a styling language 
for as far as I know.
