<h1>Our Progress Over the Whole Week</h1>
Our week started off well, we had an idea of what we wanted to do with the drone and decided how we would achieve that goal. Our goal was to control the drone with
keys on a keyboard to make it move instead of sending commands slowly. We spent the tuesday and wednsday doing this and got pretty far but what we were working on
was actual the frontend of the drone and instead of the backend of the drone development. We then decided that we would use the command line tool as a sudo base
for our drone backend and replace the github password stuff with inputing commands into the terminal to send them quicker. We spent thursday and friday on this and
got the base set up so all we have to do is make the commands inputs for the drone.
<h1>Reflection</h1>
Overall we got some decent progress but are most likely behind on other groups at the moment.
