<h3>Introduction</h3>
Today was the first day of working with drones. Our goal was to connect to our drone
directly and give it a command to take off.
<h3>Controlling the drones</h3>
The way we controlled our drones was by setting up a UDP and then sending packets to the drones IP and port to get it to move.
This should have been somewhat simple but a majority of our class couldn't get our drones to connect to the computer. We believe
it was either the firewall or something with the wifi connection we we're using. Only one group was able to get their drone to fly
but next week we all should be able to issue commands to our drone.
